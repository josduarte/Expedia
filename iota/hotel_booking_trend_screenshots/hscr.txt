Getting hourly Hotel Booking Trend Screeshots:
---------------------------------------------

To get hourly Hotel screenshots for 6 different Properties, I decided to create a script to do part of the work and avoid human mistakes.

Basically, the script copies the text to be pasted in HipChat, to Clipboard and open the next screen to capture. Also, to speed the process, I let my Chrome window in the same size of the chart to get a full capture that is faster than mark the area to capture.

After few days doing this way, I can confirm that is faster. I added time start and time conclusion to script and my record is 1 minute and 27 seconds. Much faster that when I started ding manually. 

To run is very simple. You just need to open terminal and run:

 ./hscr.sh <HOUR> <DATE>

E.g. ./hscr.sh 2:00PM 08/22/17

Let me know if you have questions or want to know more about the script. I will be happy to explain.

Iâ€™m sharing here in case anyone needs to do one day.
