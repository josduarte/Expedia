View IPs
--------

View IPs is a simple script to get the the result for 5 ip addresses in Splunk at same time.

This is how the querie is executed by script:

start Chrome "https://splunkewe.idx.expedmz.com/en-US/app/iota/SpotABot?form.IP=%1&form.UserAgent=*&form.guid=*&form.time_set.earliest=-1mon@mon&form.time_set.latest=@mon&form.bucket=1d&form.ville=*&earliest=0&latest="

The script should run in the Jump Box, using command prompt. To transfer the BAT files there you will need to use the instructions in https://confluence/display/SPS/File+Transfers+and+Shared+Access. Basically, create a folder under //che-filidx.idx.expedmz.com/NonPCITransfer/FromCorp/Public and copy the files there. After that, in JumpBox you can get the files from \\chidxcorpfil.idxcorp.expedmz.com\PCITransfer\ToProd\Public. This service is not reliable. So here it goes another possibility:

1) Edit the vip.bat with a text editor
2) Copy all content to clipboard.
3) In JumpBox, in command prompt, execute notepad vip.bat
4) Paste all content from clipboard
5) Close and save file
6) Repeat the steps with view_ips.bat

Copy the files to your user folder and using command prompt run from there:

view_ips <ip1> <ip2> ... <ip5>

E.g.

c:\users\josduarte> view_ips 107.77.245.4 107.77.249.8 107.77.249.7 107.77.253.1 107.77.165.8

The command above will start 5 tabs in Chrome each one getting the numbers for each IP.
